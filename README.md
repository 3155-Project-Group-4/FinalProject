# FinalProject


# Fine Tuning the Proposal

1) Do we have the final version of context diagram? If yes, include it. If no, when will that be ready?

2) How quickly we can finalize the DFD (first one) and the use case diagram?

If yes, include it. If no, when will that be ready?

3) Do we need a database? If yes, what type is it and what is its model?

4) Can we schedule some development activities beyond finalizing modeling ?

5) The modeling activities are assigned to everyone. After modeling is done, you can assign tasks to teams of 2 preferably or individual team members or the entire team.

6) Can you start working on the details of all the sprints until the final due date now? If yes, start doing it. If no, when will you be able to do that?
